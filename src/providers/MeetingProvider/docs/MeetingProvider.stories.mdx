# MeetingProvider

The `MeetingProvider` is the **root provider** for building a realtime meeting application. It is responsible for rendering out a series of providers and providing a `MeetingManager` class that helps integration with the Chime JavaScript SDK. The `MeetingManager` has APIs for joining, starting, and leaving a meeting.

It takes a prop to update the `MeetingManager` log level. This log level is defined by the [LogLevel](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/loglevel.html) enum in `amazon-chime-sdk-js`.

```javascript
enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG,
  INFO,
  WARN,
  ERROR,
  OFF
}
```

You can access the `MeetingManager` instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

## Importing

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

Render the `MeetingProvider` near the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

## Props

<Props of={MeetingProvider} />
